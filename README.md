# odiBLe READ-ME

This is the GitHub repository of odiBLe: a Julia implementation of one-dimensional inhomogeneous Balescu-Lenard equation for 1D self-gravitating systems.

It contains 2 directories : 
  - odiBLe_KiT, dedicated to the computation of the associated kinetic theory of 1D self-gravitating systems (diffusion, friction, flux ...),
  - odiBLe_Sim, dedicated to N-body simulations of 1D self-gravitating systems (to compare with the predictions made using odiBLe_KiT).

Each directory has its own README file and ready-to-use examples.
This repository is linked to the following scientific paper : https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.106.044118
